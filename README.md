Flutter Category List App (Riverpod Example)
This Flutter project demonstrates robust state management using Riverpod for a category listing feature. It includes a 5-tab bottom navigation, with the "Category" tab showcasing session-persistent data loading (fetches only once per session), pagination/infinite scrolling, and clear UI state handling (Loading, Success, Error, Empty).
The app utilizes Riverpod's StateNotifierProvider to manage the category list, loading status, and error states. It features immutable data models (const constructor, copyWith), simulates paginated data fetching from a mock repository, and follows a clean, feature-based folder structure. Other navigation tabs display simple placeholder screens.
Key Tech: Flutter, Riverpod.
To Run:
Clone the repo.
flutter pub get
flutter run
